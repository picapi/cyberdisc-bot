You've reached the end of our little guide!

If you ever need to refresh yourself on any of this, you can reobtain the guide through running the `:tutorial` command, or take a look at #readme, which contains roughly the same information as this tutorial.

If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask - we don't bite!

We hope you have a great time here :)
