We have a series of roles available for each year group, so that there's a space for people to discuss things related specifically to their year group!

In order to obtain a year group role you'll need to run the .rank command in <#409860647170342919>. The available year group roles are
```
Year 9
Year 10
Year 11
Year 12
Year 13
Technically Adults
```
Most should be self explanatory - Technically Adults is intended for those who have finished Year 13 and are in further education, employment or whathaveyou.

ℹ The Year roles are modelled off the school years in England and Wales. For those in Northern Ireland and Scotland, you might want to pick the equivalent role.

⚠ All these roles are opt-in, but do not have any restrictions to obtaining them, apart from being mutually exclusive.
