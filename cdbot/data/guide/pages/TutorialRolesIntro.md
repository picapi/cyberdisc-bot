We've got many roles on the server, which might take a little bit of getting used to - but there's a few especially important ones to know.

Roots (with a bright red name) and Sudos (bright blue) are the Admins and Moderators of this server respectively.

⚠ **Roots and Sudos aren't CD Staff!** We're other community members like you - if you have any personal queries or problems with anything Cyber Discovery, we'd recommend you contact `support@joincyberdiscovery.com` - they'll hopefully be able to help!

Official Cyber Discovery Staff have a darker red colour - these *are* CD staff members, however they aren't able to help you with personal queries here. They do, however, drop in from time to time to say hi :)

Community Developers are some of the people who put their time into making cool projects, like the bot you're using right now!

We also have a Muted role - you probably don't want this as it keeps you from speaking in any of the channels on the server!

There's also a variety of roles relating to Achievements, Elite and Year groups, too much to fit here! If you'd like more info on them, click on the 🏆, 👑, or 🎂 reactions respectively, and click ▶ when finished.
