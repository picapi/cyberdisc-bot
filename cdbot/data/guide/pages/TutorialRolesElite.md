There's a series of roles relating to CyberStart Elite, the last stage of the Cyber Discovery program each year.

ℹ Most of the following roles aren't obtainable anymore - however there's likely to be new equivalent roles when Elite next rolls around!

Veteran 2018 and Veteran 2019 is given to any member who provides proof that they qualified for CyberStart Elite in the relevant year. If you see someone with these roles, it's likely that they know their stuff!

During Elite 2019, students within the Older age group were able to pick between two courses - one based on Forensics and the other on Incident Handling. Each person has a respective role, being Forensicator and Cyberist respectively.

The Elite Talent Development role is given to those who were invited to participate in the Elite Talent Development program - an invite-only scheme Cyber Discovery are running to help get people into industry!

ℹ To obtain any of these roles, you need to provide proof - it's only logical, right?
