We have a series of roles available to those who go above and beyond by completing significant parts of CyberStart Game and Essentials.

For CyberStart Game, roles are available for the completion of each base individually (HQ, Moonbase, Forensics and Volcano); alongside a shiny 100 Percent role if you complete all four!

For CyberStart Essentials, a role is available for completing the Final Exam.
If you've also achieved 100% in CyberStart Game, you're also awarded the True 100% role!

In order to claim one or more of these roles, currently you'll need to DM a **Screen Recording** of a relevant page clearly displaying your success. This screen recording must include the browser in use being refreshed. Feel free to redact any personally identifying information, all we want to see is the shiny 100%!

âš  Don't try to fool us! Doctoring or otherwise falsifying evidence of completion is an easy way to get yourself banned from the server - it's not worth it!
